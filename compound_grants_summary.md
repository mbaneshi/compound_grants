### Summary
The Compound Grants Program (CGP) domain seeks proposals that contribute innovative developer tools, dapps, and ideas that integrate securely and effectively with Compound III (Comet) contracts, driving ecosystem value. The program focuses on three main categories: new ideas that enhance the ecosystem, developer tools for integration and improvement, and dapp integrations that attract new users or activity. Successful proposals are well-articulated, demonstrate an understanding of the Compound community, and include measurable, outcome-oriented milestones. Proposals that require smart contract interactions must undergo a security audit with Open Zeppelin.
